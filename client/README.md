## Project structure

In order to scale the application in the easiest and most maintainable way, keep most of the code inside the features folder, which should contain different feature-based things. Every feature folder should contain domain specific code for a given feature. This will allow you to keep functionalities scoped to a feature and not mix its declarations with shared things. This is much easier to maintain than a flat folder structure with many files.

### `Assets`

Assets folder can contain all the static files such as images, fonts, etc.

### `Components`

Contains UI sharable components. These components can be used in any part of the app as their logic is not linked to a particular process.

### `Config`

All the global configuration, env variables etc. get exported from here and used in the app

### `Features`
